## Overview:
We intend to build an android application to allow the patients in saudi arabia to book an appointment in finest doctors near them, and review them after that which could ease the process to find the proper doctors for their situation.
We will use Android Studio IDE to build such an app and connect it to the google cloud platform to access the database using php language.
